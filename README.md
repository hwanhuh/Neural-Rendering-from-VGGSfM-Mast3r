# Gaussian Splatting from VGGSfM and Mast3r, and Their Comparison

This project aims to explore Gaussian Splatting using two different wild deep-based camera-pose & 3D pointcloud reconstruction methodologies: VGGSfM and Mast3r. The objective is to compare their performances and understand the advantages and limitations of each approach.

## Project Structure

- **VGGSfM**: Implementation and results of (2D) Gaussian Splatting using VGGSfM.
- **Mast3r**: Implementation and results of (2D) Gaussian Splatting using Mast3r.
- **Comparison**: Detailed comparison of the two methods based on various performance metrics.

## VGGSfM vs Mast3r 

This project uses the following projects:
- [VGGSfM](https://github.com/facebookresearch/vggsfm.git)
- [Mast3r](https://github.com/naver/mast3r.git)



## Setup Instructions
